Download a single file from a remote ftp server to your machine:

sftp {user}@{host}:{remoteFileName} {localFileName}
Upload a single file from your machine to a remote ftp server:

sftp {user}@{host}:{remote_dir} <<< $'put {local_file_path}'



If you have Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, you can enable mongo to start on boot typing this in your console: 
sudo systemctl enable mongod
I have used this approach with MongoDB Community Edition 3.6 and it works. Reboot your machine and test if mongo is running typing: 
sudo service mongod status
